# Cross-Platform Architecture & Development Guidelines

This skill codifies the architectural, structural, and testing standards required to build low-latency, deterministic, cross-platform components for AlienTech.Software projects (such as AlienVox)[cite: 3, 4, 5].

## 1. Core Principles

### Factory Owner, Not Coder
- **Anchor to Intent:** Your goal is to express and fulfill the developer's exact stated intent. If instructions or requirements are ambiguous, you must stop and ask; never silently infer context.
- **Zero Shortcuts:** You are strictly forbidden from taking shortcuts, collapsing multiple complex tasks into single compromises, or skipping steps because an implementation is complex. Keeping an application simple means executing clean, unbloated designs—it *never* means delivering an incomplete, cut-corner, or incorrect feature.
- **Surface Assumptions:** Explicitly state what you are about to assume and wait for user confirmation before executing any code changes.

### Anti-Mocking Testing Philosophy
- **Real Code Execution:** Mocking dependencies is strongly discouraged. Unit tests and functional integration pipelines must execute actual, deterministic code branches against real buffers wherever possible.
- **Concrete Test Data:** Provide explicit, real-world mock data files, clipboard structures, or memory state vectors to test the genuine logic branches rather than simulating structural responses through arbitrary mock interfaces.

## 2. Structural Patterns: The Bridge & Suffix Isolation

Every system-level subsystem must be separated into a platform-agnostic abstract contract layer and isolated, platform-specific concrete implementations.

### 2.1 File Suffix Mapping Rules
For standalone or lightweight structural integrations, use strict suffix tracking:
- `*._core.*` / `*._base.*` — Contains the common interface/trait definition. Absolutely no platform imports allowed.
- `*_win.*` — Isolated platform execution for Windows 11 (Win32, COM, UI Automation APIs).
- `*_mac.*` — Isolated platform execution for macOS 14+ (Cocoa, AppKit, AVFoundation APIs).
- `*_lnx.*` — Isolated platform execution for Linux kernels (X11, Wayland, DBus).

### 2.2 Subsystem Directory Isolation
For intricate multi-file pipelines (e.g., local OCR engines or native accessibility tree scrapers), separate modules inside platform-specific child directories managed by a top-level dispatcher:

```text
services/<subsystem-name>/
├── mod.rs                   # Directs compilation dynamically based on target_os
├── interface.rs             # Houses the abstract traits or shared definitions
├── win/                     # Fully cordoned Windows logic paths
│   └── text_grabber.rs
└── mac/                     # Fully cordoned macOS logic paths
    └── text_grabber.rs
